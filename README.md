### Emotion Detection

## Detecting emotions of live twitter feed

# Two Algorithms used

* Restricted Boltzman Machine (RBM)
* Naive Bayes 

To run the codes for emotion detection first compile and run the getTweets.java present in each folder by giving the tweet subject as the command line argument. On running the code you will generate a text file Tweets.txt on which the machine learning models will test themselves.

The file text_emotion.csv (which I found somewhere on the internet) is meant to train both the models. After the file Tweets.txt is generated just compile and run NaiveBayes.java and rbm3.java to train and test them respectively.
